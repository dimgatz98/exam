/boot/vmlinux: – The Linux kernel file
RIP: internal gateway protocol using bellman-ford (complexity O(V  E))
Interrupts: come from devices or CPU (handled by kernel). Synchronous-> at runtime by the CPU (e.g. traps, overflows etc). Asynchronous->external. Maskable-> from INTR pin, can be ignored. non-maskable-> from NMI pin, can't be ignored. Every interrupt is matched with an interrupt handler.
Qcow: is a disk image format used by QEMU , a virtual machine hypervisor that runs inside another operating system. Qcow stands for QEMU Copy On Write and uses a disk storage optimization strategy that delays storage allocation until it is actually needed.

The X Window System: (X11, or simply X) is a windowing system (software suite that manages separately different parts of display screens. It is a type of graphical user interface (GUI) which implements the WIMP (windows, icons, menus, pointer) paradigm for a user interface) for bitmap displays, common on Unix-like operating systems.
lsblk: list block devices (blk = block)
/run: - It stores volatile runtime data.

/usr/share:	It contains architecture independent shareable text files.
AutoFS: controls the operations of automount daemons. Automount daemons automatically mounts filesystems (e.g. NFS, ext3, ext4, xfs etc.) when in use and unmounts them after a period of inactivity. This is done based on a set of pre-configured maps. The major drawback of the Linux fstab is the number of mounting point information. When we add the number of mount point information to it, it will assign the dedicated resources to handle it irrespective of how frequently the users are accessing the mounted file system. Unnecessary system resources are consumed, and the system performance will be degraded.
netstat:  Print network connections, routing tables, interface statistics, masquerade connections, and multicast memberships
Interrupt context: Interrupt context is when the interrupt occurs state/priority goes to interrupt handler, and current process stops/saves until we complete interrupt, Interrupt context is not time consumable, non preemptable, It cannot go into the sleep.
HugePages: In modern-day architecture, multiple page size support is provided; for example, x86 CPUs can support 4K and 2M page sizes (if architectural support is available, 1G page size is also supported), whereas ia64 supports 4K, 8K, 64K, 256K, and so on. Hugepages have something known as a translation lookaside buffer (abbreviated as TLB) which facilitates caching of virtual to physical translations. With bigger and bigger physical memory now getting available, optimizing the scarce TLB resource in supporting hugepages is becoming more critical. When the nr_hugepages option changes (in /etc/sysctl.conf), the administrator can allocate persistent hugepages on the kernel boot line command. This allocation can free up hugepages as well if required.

These queues contain lists of the runnable processes at each priority level. The priority arrays also contain a priority bitmap used to efficiently discover the highest-priority runnable task in the system. The active array contains all the tasks in the associated runqueue that have timeslice (run time on CPU) left. The expired array contains all the tasks in the associated runqueue that have exhausted their timeslice. When each task's timeslice reaches zero, its timeslice is recalculated before it is moved to the expired array. When the active array becomes empty, the two array pointers are switched etc.

The starting address for the new mapping is specified in addr.  The length argument specifies the length of the mapping (which must be greater than 0).
The intent of the modified interface is to reduce the portion of the guest's execution time spent performing operations which are substantially more difficult to run in a virtual environment compared to a non:virtualized environment. The paravirtualization provides specially defined 'hooks' to allow the guest(s) and host to request and acknowledge these tasks, which would otherwise be executed in the virtual domain (where execution performance is worse).
